    "\n",
    "<h3>What is convolution</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, given the name, its pretty obvious that a convolutional neural network is a neural network with convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "And so in order to understand CNNs, we must first understand convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Is Convolution Mysterious?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we want to mention that, convolution is sometimes treated as this mysterious thing\n",
    "\n",
    "But as with our discussion with machine learning, we want to take the dum as possible approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure convolution can be complex, its an essential operation in signal processing and computer vision, but in fact its quite simple\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only two requirements, addition and multiplication, believe it or not, convolution is just adding and multiplying\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>A \"no math\" look at convolution</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "So lets start by not doing any math, lets just look at convolution qualitatively\n",
    "\n",
    "With convolution, there are three objects we want to pay attention to\n",
    "\n",
    "first is the <strong>input image</strong>, second there is the <strong>filter</strong>, note that another name for the filter is the <strong>kernel</strong>, so we are going to use those two terms interchangeably, finally there is the <strong>output image</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "The output image is what we get when we <strong>convolve</strong> the input image with the filter\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if we perform the convolution operation on the input image and the filter, we get the output image\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical symbol for convolution is $*$, not to be used with the ```*```  that we use in computer programming for multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we are writing convolution in code, it will not be an $*$, because in code we already use the ```*``` for multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>This is called \"Bluring\"</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Its hhelpful to think of some examples of convolution to understand what it can do\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two examples which may come to our preference\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example is blurring\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='extras/38.1.PNG'></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "So the input image is just the original image, and the output image is just a blurred version of that image\n",
    "\n",
    "We might recognise this operation from applications such as photoshop\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Edge Detection</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The second example is edge detection\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='extras/38.2.PNG'></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "As input we have the original image, and as output we get white lines where there are edges in the original image and we get black where there are no edges\n",
    "\n",
    "So the output image highlights all the edges in the original input image\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Convolution = Image Modifier</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "So thats our first lesson on how to view convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "This perspective is that convolution is an image modifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The input is the original image, and the output is a modified or a transformed version of that image\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='extras/38.3.PNG'></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we might think of this as a <strong>feature transformation</strong> on the input image\n",
    "\n",
    "That sounds curiously like what a neural network does (hmmmmmmmm)\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, what makes bluring and edge detection actually work if they are both convolution ?\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes one convolution different from another convolution ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well the answer is the filter!\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use a gaussian filter, this blurs the image, when we use an edge detection filter, we get edge detection, we can think of that as sharpening the image\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next question might be, how do we find or design these filters in the first place ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats something we will discuss later in this notebook, but the answer, as we might have come to expect, is just another dum as possible approach\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section we are going to continue our discussion of convolution by looking at a totally different perspective on how it works\n",

    "<h3>Vectorisation</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Something we mention very often is vectorisation\n",
    "\n",
    "We like to vectorise operations in code, because using numpy functions is a lot more effecient than writing our own python for loops\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern we are looking for when we want to vectorise an operation is usually of the form of a dot product\n",
    "\n",
    "A dot product is an element-wise multiplication and then the summation of those results\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large a^Tb = \\sum^N_{i=1}a_ib_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This also applies to matrix multiplication, since if $A$ and $B$ are matricies, then the matrix multiplication of $A$ and $B$ is just $A \\cdot B$\n",
    "\n",
    "We notice that for convolution, we yet again have something similar\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large (A * W)_{ij} = \\sum^{K-1}_{i^\\prime=0}\\sum^{K-1}_{j^\\prime=0} A(i+i^\\prime,j+j^\\prime)w(i^\\prime,j^\\prime)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference is that there are two summations\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not really a relevant detail, since the outcome is still the same\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of summing over one axis, we are summing over two axes, but its still an element-wise sum and add\n",
    "\n",

    "<h3>Why is the dot product important?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is, why is the dot product important?\n",
    "\n",
    "One definition of the dot product, other than the element-wise sum and add, is \n",

    "\n",
    "<img src='extras/38.9.PNG' width='300'></img>\n",

    "Finally, imagine that the angle between two vectors is $180^\\circ$, this is basically as far apart as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='extras/38.10.PNG' width='300'></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then $\\cos(180)=-1$, which is the minimum value of the cosine\n",

    "<h3>Cosine Similarity</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we are just using raw cosine, then its a similarity\n",

    "$$\\large cos \\theta_{ab} = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{\\vert a \\vert \\vert b \\vert} = \\text{ how similar are a and b}$$\n",

    "The minimum value, when $a$ and $b$ are anti-parallel is $-1$\n",

    "consider now how we would find the cosine of the angle between two vectors\n",

    "$$\\large cos(a,b) = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{\\vert a \\vert \\vert b \\vert} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits^N_{i=1} a_ib_i}{\\sqrt{\\sum\\limits^N_{i=1}a_i^2}\\sqrt{\\sum\\limits^N_{i=1}b_i^2}}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "The first one from before was that, we were actually doing what is called the cross-correlation\n",

    "And second, now we have that, dot prodcut, is actually very similar to the pearson correlation\n",

    "<h3>What is a dot product</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "So hopefully by this point, we are convinced that the dot product, although seems like an abstact convept, can be thought of as a correlation measure\n",
    "\n",
    "It tells us, how correlated is the first thing with the second thing\n",
    "\n",
    "If they are highly positively correlated, then the dot product should be large and positive, that means two vectors pointing in nearly the same direction\n",
    "\n",
    "If they are highly negatively correlated, then the dot product should be large and negative, that means two vectors pointing in nearly opposite directions\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if the two vectors are orthogonal (at right angles), then the dot prodcut should be zero\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Why do tihs?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason wht this is important is, we dont need to think of a filter as an abstact concept, in fact is just a pattern finder\n",
    "\n",
    "This actually makes the term filter make a lot more sense, it filters out everything not related to the pattern contained in the filter by setting them to zero, and keeps everything that is related to the pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='extras/38.11.PNG'></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "So what convolution is doing is, its passing this filter along each point on the original input image and sliding it along\n",
    "\n",
    "At each point it asks, is the pattern here?, is the pattern here?, is the pattern here?, and so forth\n",
    "\n",
    "Then it gives us a high number in the positions where the pattern is found and then a small number where the pattern is not found\n",
    "\n",
    "And thus, our first alternative perspective on convolution is that, its just a sliding pattenr finder that passes through an entire image, looking for a particular pattern\n",
