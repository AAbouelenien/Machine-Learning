    "<h3>RL Trader Section Introduction</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually when people think about applying machine learning to the stock market, they usually think about it in terms of predicting the value of a stock which includes even just the direction like whether it will go up tomorrow or down tomorrow\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course that information by itself doesn't do anything physically\n",
    "\n",
    "We still need to sit down at our computer and make a trade\n",
    "\n",
    "If we're talking about automated high frequency trading, then that's a different story\n",
    "\n",
    "Even so let's say our model predicts that the stocks we are looking at will go up tomorrow\n",
    "\n",
    "Does that mean we'll make a trade?\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we're busy and we forget\n",
    "\n",
    "Or what if we believe it's going to go up only slightly and then decrease rapidly \n",
    "\n",
    "Then probably we don't want to buy that stock\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the key difference between traditional supervised and unsupervised learning versus reinforcement learning \n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning only makes a prediction, it doesn't actually take any action based on that prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "We can predict tomorrow's stock price but we still have to choose whether we will act on that information or not\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning on the other hand, not only makes predictions but also takes actions in the environment that we provide\n",
    "\n",
    "So in this notebook of the series, we are going to study how a reinforcement learning algorithm might take such actions in a stock trading environment\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Rough Outline</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's just go over a rough outline of how this is going to work\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently we probably just think of stock prices as a simple time series dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "At this time it has this value at the next time it has this other value and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "That sounds more appropriate for a recurrent neural network rather than reinforcement learning\n",
    "\n",
    "So what makes this a reinforcement learning problem\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>A matter of perspective</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Well it's a matter of perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine let's say we're hooked up to a stock trading API \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this API you can call functions which do real world financial transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we call `api.buy('GOOG',10)`, that means we're going to buy `10` shares of `Google` stock\n",
    "\n",
    "If each share is worth fifty dollars, that means five hundred dollars is going to be deducted from our bank account and instead we will now own 10 shares of Google\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we call `api.sell('AAPL',5)`, that means we just sold five shares of Apple stock\n",
    "\n",
    "If one share of Apple is worth thirty dollars then we will now receive one hundred fifty dollars in our bank account and we will own five less shares of Apple stock than we did before\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly we can see that the act of calling these functions is an action\n",
    "\n",
    "We might think of our state as information such as recent stock prices, how much cash we have to buy more stocks, how many shares of each stock we own, the values of those stocks and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment is the actual stock market\n",
    "\n",
    "It's inherently random because we can't really predict what's going to happen to tomorrow's stock price\n",
    "\n",
    "But our actions affect the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words these are all the ingredients we need to specify our problem as a reinforcement learning problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We can perform actions such as buy and sell in the environment and our state is made up of information about various stocks in our own portfolio and the environment is the stock market itself\n",
    "\n",
    "The reward is some function of the money we made or lost \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Are we a reinforecement learning agent?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Something useful to try, which is probably something many of us have done already is to think about how we ourselves are a reinforcement learning agent\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are looking at a stock and trying to decide whether or not to purchase some shares, we generally want to follow the rule buy low sell high\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='extras/59.1.PNG' width='400'>\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example here we can see a dip in value\n",
    "\n",
    "This would be a really good time to buy\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also see a peak\n",
    "\n",
    "This would be a really good time to sell, well only if we need the money\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully we are investing in something where the general trend is always going up, so if we don't need the money then the best thing to do is just let it sit and continue to increase in value\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course the problem is that in the real world we are trying to make these decisions without knowledge of the future\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you know if the most recent price is a dip or a peak\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact we do not\n",
    "\n",
    "And so perhaps this is a job best left for the machines"

    "Of course we would not want to try such an experiment with real money\n",
    "\n",
    "So really our job is to figure out how to build an environment object in code that simulates the stock market \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Enviroment API</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Here's how we can think of the API for an environment \n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, If we're familiar with OpenAI Gym then this is probably just review for us\n",
    "\n",
    "But it's good to go over this anyway\n",
    "\n",
    "So the idea is this\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "env = MyTradingSimulationEnv()\n",
    "done = False\n",
    "state = env.reset() # bring us back to initial staate\n",
    "while not done:\n",
    "    action = get_action(state) # could come from our agent\n",
    "    # perform the trade, 'info' contains portofolio value\n",
    "    next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)\n",
    "    state = next_state\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "First we are going to instantiate an environment object\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we are going to initialise a boolean `done` flag equal a `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also going to call `env.reset()` which puts us back into the starting position for this environment and returns the initial state\n",
    "\n",
    "As a side note this state vector may not be at a good scale to pass into a neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "As we recall, remember that we like to normalize data before passing it into a neural network or linear regression \n",
    "\n",
    "So keep in mind that we can do this as an optional step \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we are going to enter a loop which only quits when `done` becomes `True` \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the loop, we are going to choose an action to perform in the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This might come from our agent but that's not a necessary detail at this stage because we are only thinking about the API for the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We could just as easily choose a random action although most likely this will lead to a suboptimal reward\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to actually perform the action in the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We do that by calling `env.step()` and passing in the action as an argument \n",
    "\n",
    "This will return a few things\n",
    "\n",
    "First it returns the next state\n",
    "\n",
    "Second it returns the reward for arriving in the next state\n",
    "\n",
    "Third it returns a done flag to tell us whether or not the episode is over\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally it returns and info dictionary which can tell us additional information about the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This one is not strictly necessary and in fact it's empty for many environments but for us we're actually going to populate the info dictionary to tell us the current value of our portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a part of the state but can be calculated from the state variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus it's easier to simply calculate it inside the environment and return it along with everything else\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we assign the next state variable to the state variable in the case where on the next step the agent needs to use the state to choose an action\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's pretty simple and we'll find that in general no matter what environment you are looking at it's going to have an API just like what we saw \n",
    "\n",
    "The questions we really want to answer now are what should the state be and what should the action be and what should the reward be\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we need to discuss these is because there are an endless number of possibilities and complications\n",
    "\n",
    "We are necessarily going to have to simplify the problem a little bit but first lets explain why this simplification is necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>State</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the state\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many things we could consider here\n",
    "\n",
    "First we can think of it exactly like a time series problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the pattern of stock movements in the past and from that make a decision\n",
    "\n",
    "That's probably the first thing we would do when we decide if we're going to buy or sell a stock\n",
    "\n",
    "However there are other things to consider\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have to ask do we own enough cash to buy the stocks we want to buy \n",
    "\n",
    "And given the prices of existing shares we own, is it worth it to sell them in order to get more cash to buy a different stock\n",
    "\n",
    "So in fact this can become a complex decision problem\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to borrow some ideas from a paper called `Practical Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Stock Trading`\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach used a more advanced reinforcement learning technique known as `DDPG` but we can apply a few of the ideas they proposed\n",
    "\n",
    "So here's how we're going to represent our state\n",
    "\n",
    "It will consist of three parts \n",
    "\n",
    "First we're going to record how many shares of each stock we own\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example if we're looking at Apple Motorola and Starbucks, `[3 5 7]` means we own three shares of Apple five shares of Motorola and seven Shares of Starbucks \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we're going to list out the current share price of each stock\n",
    "\n",
    "So this means Apple is trading at fifty dollars per share\n",
    "\n",
    "Motorola is trading at twenty dollars per share\n",
    "\n",
    "And Starbucks is trading at thirty dollars per share\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the last value of the state is how much pure cash we have\n",
    "\n",
    "That's cash that's not invested in any stock which just sits there and doesn't gain any interest \n",
    "\n",
    "So let's say we have one hundred dollars in cash, then our total state vector will be `[3 5 7 50 20 30 100]` \n",
    "\n",
    "We should be able to confirm that if we have $N$ stocks than the size of our state vector will $2N+1$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Actions</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's consider the actions \n",
    "\n",
    "Again if we consider the sheer amount of possibilities the action space would be extremely large \n",
    "\n",
    "For any given stock, we have three possible options\n",
    "\n",
    "We can sell We can buy or We can hold, which means do nothing\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we might think three is not bad\n",
    "\n",
    "But now remember we have three stocks to consider \n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these, we can exercise any of the three options above\n",
    "\n",
    "So that gives us $3^3$ possible actions or $27$ actions\n",
    "\n",
    "For example our action vector maybe `[sell sell sell]` which means sell our Apple shares sell our Motorola shares and sell our Starbucks shares \n",
    "\n",
    "Or it might be `[buy sell hold]` which means buy Apple shares sell Motorola shares and do nothing with our Starbucks shares \n",
    "\n",
    "However this is still not the end of the story because this doesn't say anything about how many shares to buy or sell\n",
    "\n",
    "If we own ten shares of a stock, we can sell anywhere from zero to 10 of those shares\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily we are going to simplify this problem a little bit\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Actions (Simplified)</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "So here's how we're going to treat actions in our example\n",
    "\n",
    "It's going to be extremely simplified compared to how things work in the real world but it's a decent start\n",
    "\n",
    "First we're not going to consider any transaction costs\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if we buy shares using our bank's investing platform usually that would cost us ten dollars or so\n",
    "\n",
    "For us it will be zero \n",
    "\n",
    "Next when we sell, We will always sell all of our shares for that stock\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's say we own 10 shares of Apple stock and we decide to sell\n",
    "\n",
    "That means we sell all 10 shares \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly when we buy we are going to buy as many shares as possible for the stock we choose to buy\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we might wonder, if we choose multiple stocks to buy and we want to buy as many as possible, how can we do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well it's kind of ambiguous\n",
    "\n",
    "We might think we want to choose the stocks in such a way that leads to using up as much cash as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "But in fact this is actually a hard problem known as the knapsack problem\n",
    "\n",
    "So what we're going to do is we're going to take a simple greedy approach \n",
    "\n",
    "Loop through every stock and buy one share of each stock and keep doing that in a loop until we run out of money\n",
    "\n",
    "Third we will also sell the stocks we want to sell before we buy anything \n",
    "\n",
    "That will leave us with more cash that we can use to buy new stocks \n",
    "\n",
    "This may seem like a very course approach, but in fact this already leaves us with 27 possible actions which means our neural network will have to approximate 27 different values which is pretty large already \n",
    "\n",
    "And so an action in this environment is not just making a single trade but rather it will involve doing all the steps in the specified order\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Reward</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we have the reward\n",
    "\n",
    "This one is simple\n",
    "\n",
    "The reward will just be the change in the value of our portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's worth thinking about how well we calculate the value of our portfolio \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example suppose, we own 10 shares of Apple 5 shares a Motorola and 3 Shares of Starbucks\n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding share prices are 50 dollars for Apple 20 dollars for Motorola and 30 dollars for Starbucks\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also suppose we have 100 dollars in cash not invested in any stock\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the total value of our portfolio will be $\\text{Value} = 10 \\times 0 + 5 \\times 20 + 3 \\times 30 + 100 = 790$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Portfolio Value</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, if we store the shares we own in a vector called $s$ and we store the corresponding share prices in an array called $p$ and we store the amount of cash we have in a variable called $c$ then the total value of our portfolio can be calculated as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "It is equal $s^Tp + c$, the reward then we'll just be the difference between these two, comparing the most recent timestep and the previous timestep\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Summary</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize this section, let's recap the important points about the environment and its implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "First our environment will be an object that mimics the OpenAI Gym API \n",
    "\n",
    "So it will have functions like `reset` and `step` which returns all the information we need to implement our reinforcement learning program\n",
    "\n",
    "Next for our environment we'll be considering three stocks Apple, Motorola and Starbucks \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, our state is a vector with three pieces of information\n",
    "\n",
    "First it includes the number of shares of each stock that we want to consider\n",
    "\n",
    "Second it includes the share price for each of those stocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Third it includes the amount of cash we have that's not invested in any stock\n",
    "\n",
    "Next our actions are a simplified subset of the large number of actions we can perform in the real world\n",
    "\n",
    "We also assume there are no transaction costs\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, we have three options for each stock buy sell or hold\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll take an all or nothing approach where if we buy we're going to buy as many shares as possible and if we sell we're going to sell all of the shares we own\n",
    "\n",
    "And these three actions can be applied in any combination for each stock we own\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we're considering three stocks then we'll have $3^3$ possible actions \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll notice that even with just three stocks and a much simplified action space we still have quite a large number of actions \n",
    "\n",
    "So if we have $N$ stocks we would have $3^N$ possible actions\n",
    "\n",
    "It grows exponentially with the number of stocks we own, so encoding the actions in this way will not scale if we have many stocks to consider \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the reward is just the change in value of our portfolio from the previous steps to the current step\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of our portfolio is just the price of each stock we own times the number of shares we own plus any on invested cash we have"

    "\n",
    "<h3>Practical Implementation</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "But that was just conceptual\n",
    "\n",
    "We could implement it like that but we choose to implement it like this since it makes things a little nicer if we want to extend this model in the future \n",
    "\n",
    "For example we could do something like plug in a tensorflow model and build a neural network instead\n",
    "\n",
    "So here's what we do\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our model has $K$ outputs we have $K$ output predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say for simplicity's sake that $K=3$, so we have 3 actions $a_1,a_2,a_3$ and let's say we perform the action $a_2$ in the environment, so those are the weights we want to update and that's the action that the target corresponds to \n",
    "\n",
    "But in a model like we would have with tensorflow or scikit-learn our targets must have the same shape as our output prediction\n",
    "\n",

    "We know what the target for a $Q(s,a)$ should be, that's the target we calculated earlier \n",
    "\n",
    "But in order for this to be equivalent to what we discussed previously we want the error for all the other actions to be $0$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve this, we can simply make the target for those actions equal to the prediction \n",
    "\n",
    "In that way the waits for those actions will not be updated\n",

    "<h3>Momentum</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another small modification we are going to make is that instead of plain vanilla gradient descent we are going to use gradient descent with momentum\n",

    "$$\\large v(t) = \\mu v(t-1) - \\eta g(t) \\\\ g(t) = \\text{gradient at time t} \\\\ \\mu = \\text{momentum term (0.9,0.99,etc)} \\\\ \\eta = \\text{learning rate}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "To give ourselves an intuitive analogy, we can think of it as the difference between riding a bicycle and walking \n",
    "\n",
    "When we're walking, we take a step, after we step we land in a new place, in order to keep moving we must take another step\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare that to riding a bicycle on a horizontal road \n",
    "\n",
    "Every time we pedal we will accelerate forward, but importantly even if we stop pedaling we still keep moving forward although eventually we will\n",
    "slow down and stop \n",

    "Now we might think, this significantly deviates from how we derived the Q-learning update\n",
    "\n",
    "It's morphing into something different at each step of the way\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we follow the logic it makes sense\n",
    "\n",
    "First we looked at Monte Carlo methods which use the sample mean to estimate the expected value of the return\n",
    "\n",
    "That seems logical because that's essentially the basis for Monte Carlo methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we realise that we can convert the sample mean expressionis into an expression that resembles gradient descent with a learning rate of 1/N\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact this is gradient descent where the latest sample is the target and the error function is just the squared error \n",
    "\n",
    "Since it's just gradient descent, there is nothing wrong with us using a constant learning rate instead of the decaying learning rate\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact a constant learning rate is better since our policy changes over time in value iteration and hence the distribution of our samples is changing over time\n",
    "\n",
    "So that seems logical as well\n",
    "\n",
    "Third we go from Monte Carlo to temporal difference methods where we simply replace the target which was the full return into a one that prediction of the return\n",
    "\n",
    "That's also a logical step, nothing wrong with that\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally since this is just gradient descent, where we have some input and some target and the squared error there is also nothing wrong with us using variance of gradient descent which improve the learning process such as momentum\n",

    "First we noted that the target is only a scalar while we have $K$ different outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the target corresponds only to the action we took\n",
    "\n",
    "And so one thing we can do is index the weight matrix and bias vector by that action when we do the update \n",

    "Another way to do it is to make a target which also has size $K$ but make it so that the target equals the prediction for any action we didn't take\n",

    "\n",
    "First in order to really evaluate the agent, we have to have something to compare it to \n",
    "\n",
    "A reasonable benchmark we think is to see how a completely random agent performs \n",
    "\n",
    "That's equivalent to running a script with epsilon = 1 one or to not have an agent at all\n",

    "But also there are some pretty low values here too where we have lost money\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of that happening is not insignificant\n",
    "\n",
    "On average however the profit is still not bad\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>What is our baseline?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to our trained agent, uur trained agent performs much better \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of losing money is much less and the floor is only just under the initial investment\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course this really depends on the hyper parameters we choose and the final values of the weights, and sometimes if we run the script we can still get results that are not much better than random\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>How can a random strategy profit?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're probably wondering, how is it that even if we take purely random actions we can still make a decent profit?\n",

    "Well it has to do with our data dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='extras/59.6.PNG' width='350'>\n",

    "In general for the three stocks we chose, the value is increasing\n",

    "\n",
    "But if the stock is mostly going up then there's less of a chance of that happening\n",

    "Of course this now becomes somewhat of an engineering problem because you have to gather all this data for every day in the span of five years \n",
    "\n",
    "Two, another thing you could do is incorporate past values into the state\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently the model doesn't have any concept of the movement of stock prices\n",
    "\n",
    "It only knows the current stock prices, the number of shares and the ininvested cash\n",
    "\n",
    "Three, we could try using returns instead of actual prices\n",
    "\n",
    "If we recall, extrapolation is harder than interpolation \n",
    "\n",
    "With stock prices which are always going up, the future stock prices will always lead to our model doing extrapolations rather than interpolations\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we use returns instead of prices, the signal should be more stationary and we should be looking at values that don't change significantly over time"
