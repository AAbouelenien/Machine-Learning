    "\n",
    "The first thing we'll notice is how different reinforcement learning is from supervised and unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to graphically show how close each of these are we can see here that supervised and unsupervised learning aren't that different\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='extras/53.1.PNG' width='800'></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of supervised learning might be spam detection\n",
    "\n",
    "When an email arrives in our inbox, our e-mail application tries to classify whether it's spam or not spam\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is image classification, given an image we might want to determine what kind of object is in the image\n",
    "\n",
    "For example a car truck traffic light Pedestrian Bicycle and so forth\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='extras/53.2.PNG' width='500'></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can imagine how that might be useful for a self-driving car\n",
    "\n",
    "How about unsupervised learning some examples of that might be clustering genetic sequences so we can determine the ancestry of different families or different types of animals (cant determine if this is referencing evoultion, in either case evolution is a myth :) )\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is topic modeling given a set of documents we can determine which documents discuss the same or similar topics \n",
    "\n",
    "With the amount of data on the Internet growing every day, we can imagine that hand labeling everything would be an infeasible task \n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is very useful in this case\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas we've drawn a supervised and unsupervised learning on the left, in contrast reinforcement learning is way out to the right to give us some idea of how different these paradigms are\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of reinforcement learning are playing humans strategy games such as tic tac toe go and chess\n",
    "\n",
    "And another example is playing video games such as Starcraft, Super Mario and doom \n",
    "\n",
    "So already we can see how reinforcement learning does things which sound a lot like things that humans can do which can be very dynamic\n",

    "<h3>Supervised / Unsupervised Interfaces</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "With supervised and unsupervised learning, we always imagine the same interface which we've modeled around scikit learn \n",
    "\n",
    "For a supervised learning interface, we usually have the functions ```fit(X,Y)``` which takes in the input samples ```X``` and the targets ```Y``` and ```predict(X)``` which takes in input samples ```X``` and tries to accurately predict ```Y``` \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class SupervisedModel:\n",
    "    def fit(X,Y):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    def predict(X):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "For an unsupervised learning interface, we usually just have a ```fit``` function which only takes in some input samples ```X``` \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that there are no targets in unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we have a ```transform``` function which takes in some input samples ```X``` and turns it into a different representation that we call ```Z```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of that might be to return a mapping to some vector or a cluster identity\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class UnsupervisedModel:\n",
    "    def fit(X):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    def transform(X):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The main point of this is, supervised and unsupervised learning are actually so similar that it makes sense to put them in the same library in the first place, and it makes sense for their APIs to take on this very simple and neat format\n",
    "\n",
    "The common theme with both of these is that the interface to these is training data \n",
    "\n",
    "We take in some training data either $X$ and $Y$ or just $X$ and we call a ```fit``` function\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of supervised learning we can then make predictions on future data \n",
    "\n",
    "But in both these cases, our data $X$ and our targets $Y$ are very simple \n",
    "\n",
    "$X$ is just $N \\times D$ matrix of input data and $Y$ is just an $N$ length vector of targets\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we say all data is the same\n",
    "\n",
    "This generic format doesn't change whether we're doing biology, finance, economics or any other subject\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is just data a table of numbers \n",
    "\n",
    "We can fit most of our algorithms in one neat library called scikit learn\n",
    "\n",
    "While it might seem that we're trying to make supervised and unsupervised learning seem very simplistic, these methods can actually be quite useful\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these algorithms we can do things like face detection so that we can unlock our phone and speech recognition so that we can talk to our phone\n",

    "<h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "But Reinforcement learning is different \n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning can guide an agent for how to act in the world\n",
    "\n",
    "So the interface to a reinforcement learning agent is much more broad than just data, it's the entire environment\n",
    "\n",
    "That environment can be the real world, or it can be a simulated world like a video game\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example we could create a reinforcement learning agent to vacuum our house\n",
    "\n",
    "Then it would be interacting with the real world\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also create a reinforcement learning agent to learn how to walk\n",
    "\n",
    "That would also be interacting with the real world\n",
    "\n",
    "We can be sure that the military is interested in such technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "They want reinforcement learning agents that can replace soldiers not to only walk but fight diffuse bombs and make important decisions while they are out on a mission\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can see now why reinforcement learning is such a big leap from basic supervised and unsupervisedlearning\n",
    "\n",
    "The interface isn't just tables of data but it could potentially be the entire world\n",
    "\n",
    "Our agent is going to have sensors some cameras some microphones and accelerometer a G.P.S. and so forth\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a continuous stream of data coming in and it's constantly reading this data to make a decision about what to do in that moment\n",
    "\n",
    "It has to take into account both past and future\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't just statically classify or label things\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words a reinforcement learning agent is a thing that has a lifetime and in each step of its lifetime it has to make a decision about what to do \n",
    "\n",
    "A static supervised or unsupervised model is not\n",
    "like that\n",
    "\n",
    "It has no concept of time\n",
    "\n",
    "We give it an input and it produces a corresponding output\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Isnt it till supervised learning?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now some of us, if we are creative might think, well supervised algorithms should still be able\n",
    "to solve reinforcement learning tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if $X$ represents the state we're in, then $Y$ the target should just be the correct action to take for that state\n",
    "\n",
    "So whether we are driving a car or playing a video game or playing chess we will always do the right thing\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the problem with that, a game like Go has $8 \\times 10^{100}$ possible board positions\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can't tell right away, that is an infeasible amount of input data \n",
    "\n",
    "For comparison, ImageNet, our largest image benchmark has about $10^6$ samples \n",
    "\n",
    "So the number of samples for Go would be $94$ orders of magnitude larger than ImageNet which can already take about one day to train\n",
    "if we have state of the art hardware \n",
    "\n",
    "To give ourselves some idea, one order of magnitude larger would take 10 days to train, and two orders of magnitude larger would take 100 days to train\n",
    "\n",
    "So now imagine 94 orders of magnitude larger \n",
    "\n",
    "Also keep in mind there may not be such a thing\n",
    "as a correct action to take at all times\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't want our AI to play the same way every single time, we want to allow for creativity and stochastic behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "A supervised model even if it were feasible to train would only have one target per input \n",
    "\n",
    "So it would never be able to do human like things like say generate poetry"

    "\n",
    "Obviously the temperature isn't going to be 70 degrees in one instant and then zero degrees the next\n",
    "\n",
    "If we think about something like stock prices we clearly need to look at not just the snapshot of the stock price at a single point in time but rather the sequence of stock prices\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously we're interested in things like is the stock going up or down\n",
    "\n",
    "And obviously we don't know whether something is going up or down from just a single price\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of this is board games like chess and Go\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously the State of the board like where each of the pieces is will be dependent on where they were previously and they will have a strong effect on where they are in the future\n",
    "\n",
    "So overall we hope we're getting the idea that there are some environments where it's not just the state by itself that matters but rather the sequence of states\n",

    "\n",
    "To summarize this lecture, here's what we talked about\n",
    "\n",
    "First we looked at the multi-arms bandit problem once again and we defined some new terms to help us think about the problem more abstractly \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically the multi-arms bandit problem is a problem of choosing an action to obtain the best reward\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we discuss the contextual bandit problem where instead of just having to choose an action we also have to pay attention to the state which helps us have more fine grained control on which action to choose\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we did some foreshadowing and talked about the situation where instead of just random states which are not related to one another in terms of predicting a reward we can have states which are interdependent\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to our next notebook on Markov Decision Processes\n",
