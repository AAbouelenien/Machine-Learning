    "if the batch is of size N , the nthe two matricies are of size NxV\n",
    "\n",
    "if V = 10,000 , then we create 10,000x more data than we started with (thats each word being a single number (index) then becoming a V size vector)\n",

    "<img src='extras/27.11.PNG' width='500'></img>\n",
    " \n",
    "the question is , what is this a one hot encoding of ?\n",
    "\n",
    "remember that one-hot encoding puts a 1 wherever the original input category is\n",
    "\n",
    "so if the original input = 0 then we set one one_hot_vec[0] = 1\n",
    "\n",

    "the same pattern follows when we look at the third example\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='extras/27.13.PNG' width='500'></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "how do we generalise this ?\n",
    "\n",
    "if we have an input word k , where the one-hot vector contains all 0s except a 1 at index k\n",
    "\n",
    "Then multiplying the one-hot vector by the weight matrix is the same as selecting the kth row of the weight matrix !\n",

    "\n",
    "That means that for a batch of length N , instead of creating a one-hot encoded matrix of size NxV we can just select the rows with the N indexes , for V = 10000 , thats 10,000x the savings\n",

    "---\n",

    "<h4>Enter Nupmy</h4>\n",

    "numpy actually supports selecting multiple rows at the same time (it happens that we already did so)\n",

    "ex: W[[0,1]] gives us both the row at index 0 and the row at index 1\n",
    "\n",
    "ex : W[[0,0]] gives us a 2xD array with the row at index 0 repeated twice\n",

    "in this way we can index both rows and columns at the same time , for the rows we index 0 to N-1 in that order essentially selecting one row at a time and for the columns we just select the targets\n",
    "\n",
    "This is allowed since the one-hot targets contain mostly 0s so they dont actually contribute anything to result , and hece when we multiply them it wastes lots of time\n",
