    "In this notebook, we'll be looking at how to use the Markov Decision Process to solve real problems\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap what we've done so far and to understand where we are going next, let's quickly summarize the previous notebook\n",
    "\n",

    "<h3>Recap So Far</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the previous section, we learned about the Markov Decision Process\n",
    "\n",
    "So why was this important?\n",
    "\n",
    "The MDP is important because it gives us a framework for describing the reinforcement learning problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Without this framework, it's not clear what approach we should take\n",
    "\n",
    "But using this framework, we can imagine it like the foundation of a house or the structure of a building\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have that, we can start to build on top of it\n",
    "\n",
    "This is better than, say, taking a bunch of sticks off the ground and trying to combine them together randomly to build a house\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a house that will last for a long time, we need a strong foundation and that requires us to build from a framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework for reinforcement learning is the MDP\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, what we will see is that the Bellman equation, which we've already learned, can be used directly to solve our first important problem\n",
    "\n",
    "That is to say, all we need to do is implement the Bellman equation in Python code and we've already started to do practical work and reinforcement learning\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, so let's start by reviewing the problem that we are trying to solve\n",
    "\n",
    "This follows directly from what we learned about MDPs\n",
    "\n",
    "So to start, we have two entities interacting\n",
    "\n",
    "These two entities are the Agent and the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='extras/55.1.PNG' width='500'></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent is the thing that we are trying to program\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment is some game or some subset of the world that we want the agent to achieve some goal inside\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do the agent and the environment interact?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is entirely described by the states, actions and rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "At every time step, the agent gets to read some data from the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of these like sensors on a robot, like a camera, a temperature sensor, GPS and so forth\n",
    "\n",
    "We call this the state at the current time $t$, $s_t$ \n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, the agent also receives a reward from the environment We call this $r_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "And remember, there is no negative or positive connotation associated with the term reward\n",
    "\n",
    "The reward is not like a cookie we get for behaving well\n",
    "\n",
    "The reward is just a number\n",
    "\n",
    "So the state and the reward go from the environment to the agent \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hands, the action goes from the agent to the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what the agent does in the environment, which has the effect of possibly changing the state\n",
    "\n",
    "Pressing a button in a video game or turning a steering wheel left or right\n",
    "\n",
    "So this is our system\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two components, the agent and the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "They communicate with each other via signals called states, actions and rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what are we trying to do with this system?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are trying to program the agent to meet some objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the term objective is too generic, but also stating specific objectives like win a game of chess or when a game of tic-tac-toe are too specific\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a general technique that we can apply to all kinds of problems\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is this technique?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, we would like to program the agents such that it maximizes its sum of future rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "We call this the return\n",
    "\n",
    "We said that we would like to program our agents such that it maximises the expected return\n",
    "\n",
    "We say expected return and not just the return, since both the environment and the agents can contain randomness\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected return means the average return\n",
    "\n",
    "So it's good to distinguish the reward from the return\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't just want to maximise the reward because the reward is instantaneous\n",
    "\n",
    "Trying to maximize the reward would be too short sighted\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we would like to maximise all the rewards in our future\n",
    "\n",
    "And so how do we accomplish this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that's what we will discuss in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "But clearly, to solve this problem, we need a way to describe the agents and the environment using math\n",
    "\n",
    "The language we need is probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, both the agent and the environment are described using probability distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent is described by the policy $\\pi(a \\vert s)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "note that this can also be a deterministic function, but when we generalize that, we get a distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment is described by the state transition distribution $p(s^\\prime,r \\vert s,a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "So to recap what our job is, the state transitions should be considered fixed\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because we don't have any control over the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we do have control over the policy $\\pi$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, our ultimate goal in reinforcement learning will be to find the best pie to meet our objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Notebook online</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, so what's the outline for this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see that with this section and the following notebooks, we are always going to follow the same basic pattern \n",
    "\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, there are two tasks that we are concerned with\n",
    "\n",
    "Task number one is called the prediction problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This is when we are given a policy and we want to evaluate the value of that policy\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we want to answer the question, how good is the given policy ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Task number two is the control problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This is when we are given an environment and we want to find the optimal policy for this environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we want to answer the question, what is the best policy?\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, so hopefully that's pretty simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task number one, tell me how good a given policy is\n",
    "\n",
    "And task number two, tell me what the best policy is\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook in particular, we will look at the following methods \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve task number one, we will employ a method called iterative policy evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see that this is nothing but applying the Bellman equation repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give us a function where we can pass in a policy and get out its corresponding value \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve tasks number two, we will study a general approach known as policy improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we understand the general approach, we will apply that approach in a quite straightforward manner\n",
    "\n",
    "The first method we will look at is called policy iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "This will work, but it's not particularly efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "The second method improves upon policy iteration, and it's called value iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>The Big Picture</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "One important fact that we want to stress about this notebook is this \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be applying the Bellman equation directly\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll notice that the Bellmon equation depends on the environment dynamics which are encapsulated by the probability distribution $p(s^\\prime,r \\vert s,a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "It also depends on the policy, which can also be expressed as a probability distribution $\\pi(a \\vert s)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large V_\\pi(s) = \\sum_a \\pi(a \\vert s) \\sum_{s^\\prime} \\sum_r p(s^\\prime,r \\vert s,a) \\{r + \\gamma V_\\pi (s^\\prime) \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's reasonable to assume that we can express $\\pi(a \\vert s)$ as a distribution in code\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about $p(s^\\prime,r \\vert s,a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We ask ourselves the question, is it reasonable to assume that we know this?\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\large \\pi(a \\vert s)$ : We know this (because we programmed it)\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\large p(s^\\prime,r \\vert s,a)$ : Do we know this ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we are engineering a self-driving car or we're trying to teach a robot to walk\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that we read from your sensors will give us the state at any particular time\n",
    "\n",
    "But do we actually know these state transition distributions?\n",
    "\n",
    "This would imply that we know what the readings on our sensors will be in the next timestep \n",
    "\n",
    "Or if we can't predict them exactly, we at least know their distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will assume that this is the case\n",
    "\n",
    "But we should keep this idea in the back of our minds that in reality, this is not something we necessarily know"

    "As a side note, when we say $V(s)$, we really mean the values of $V(s)$ for all the states, but to avoid having to write down $V(s_1),V(s_2)$ and so on each time, we will just say $V(s)$ for convenience\n",

    "Let's suppose that we've initialised $V(s)$ in a variable called $A$ we'll call that $V_0(s)$\n",

    "\n",
    "So now $B$ holds the latest version of $V(s)$, we'll call that $V_1(s)$\n",
    "\n",
    "But now we don't need the old $A$ anymore so it can hold the next set of updates\n",

    "And now $A$ will hold the latest version of $V(s)$, we'll call that the $V_2(s)$\n",

    "In practice, we simply store everything in the same structure\n",

    "We don't bother to have two arrays\n",

    "<h3>Representing transition probabilities</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "So for windy Gridworld, the main new data structure we want is something to represent the transition probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this will vary widely depending on our personal design choices, but the instructor's design was to represent the probabilities as a dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "The dictionary is structured as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to our previous code, we've decided that only the next states may be probabilistic\n",
    "\n",
    "The rewards will be a deterministic function of the state\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we only need to concern ourselves with the current state, action and the next state\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to the dictionary will be a tuple of state and action\n",
    "\n",
    "These represent $s$ and $a$. ```key:(s,a)``` \n",
    "\n",
    "The value in the dictionary will be another dictionary containing the next state probabilities \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside this nested dictionary, the key will be the possible next state and the value will be the probability of going there, ```value:{s':prob}```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a dictionary with the key ```(0,2)``` and value ```0.7``` means that we will go to state ```(0,2)``` with probability ```0.7```    \n",
    " \n",

    "If there's another key ```(1,3)``` with the value ```0.3```, that means we will go to state ```(1,3)``` with probability ```0.3```\n",

    "probs = {\n",

    "For this state, we obviously want to go up since that brings us closer to the winning state\n",

    "some probability of going to the right\n",

    "Specifically, consider what will happen if the policy only changes by a small amount from one iteration to the next\n",
    "\n",
    "Say only one or two actions have changed \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the value for the new policy will not be that different from the value of the old policy\n",

    "Instead, we would like our initialization point to be close to where we want to end up \n",
    "\n",
    "To that end, instead of initializing `V` to a bunch of zeros or random numbers each time, it's more efficient to save the current `V` and use that as our initial value for the next round of policy evaluation\n",

    "In this way, we can utilize the fact that if `V` doesn't change that much, then policy evaluation will be completed in fewer steps\n",

    "<h3>Drawback of Policy Iteration</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there is one drawback to the method we just described \n",
    "\n",
    "To see this, consider that the policy improvement process is a loop\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Loop until convergance: \n",
    "    # policy evaluation\n",
    "    Loop until convergance:\n",

    "The second step is relatively efficient as it only requires a single pass through every state\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the first step policy evaluation is not efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, this step requires another loop in which we must wait for conversions\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we actually have two nested loops, both of which could potentially last for a very long time as we wait for them to converge\n",

    "<h3>2 Ideas for Improvement</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "So here are two ways that we can consider speeding up the process of policy iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "First, note that the policy itself is not really needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the policy is simply the $\\arg \\max$ of $Q$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large \\pi_{k+1}(s) = \\arg \\max_a \\sum_{s^\\prime}\\sum_r p(s^\\prime,r \\vert s,a) \\{r + \\gamma v_k(s^\\prime)\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also state this as the policy is the $\\arg \\max$ of the right hand side of the Bellman equation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we can use $V$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, note that on the subsequent step, when we want to evaluate the policy, we don't really care about the $\\arg \\max$ of this expression, we care about the actual value of this expression\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\large v_{k+1}(s) = \\max_a \\sum_{s^\\prime}\\sum_r p(s^\\prime,r \\vert s,a) \\{r + \\gamma v_k(s^\\prime)\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if we just want the value, we can take the max instead of the $\\arg max$ and forget about which action is being chosen altogether\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another key idea\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the policy evaluation step is problematic\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because this inner loop can potentially last forever\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that, practically speaking, we can cut this short by stopping when we reach some threshold for the largest change in $V(s)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we learned about one way to improve this calculation in the context of policy iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "It was that instead of initializing $V(s)$ randomly or to all zeros, we could simply start at whatever values were currently stored in $V(s)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This speeds things up, since we know that $V(s)$ won't change that much from one policy to the next\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this is that policy evaluation converges in fewer steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's one way we can extend this idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of waiting for $V(s)$ to converge, what if we simply stop the evaluation process after a few steps?\n",
    "\n",
    "And what if we take this to the extreme?\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we perform just a single step of policy evaluation?\n",
    "\n",
    "We might have a hunch that this converges since both the policy and the value function are both moving towards some optimal point\n",

    "\n",
    "We can see that it's a pretty short algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "So we start by initializing $V(s)$ randomly, except for the terminal state, which must have a value of zero\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we enter an infinite loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside this loop, we create a variable called $\\Delta$\n",
    "\n",
    "This will store the maximum change for this iteration of the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll initialize this value to zero, and we'll update it for each state that we see\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we loop through all the states in our state space except for the terminal state whose value should be fixed at zero\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the second loop, we store the current value of the $V(s)$ inside a variable called a $v_{\\text{old}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we take the $\\arg \\max$ of this expression, which is the equivalent to taking the max over all actions of the $Q$ function for the given state\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us the new value for $V(s)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is similar to what we do for policy improvement, except that instead of taking the $\\arg \\max$ we now just take the max directly and forget about the actual action we would have chosen\n",

    "Next, we update $\\Delta$ to be the max of the current $\\Delta$ and the current absolut change in $V(s)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we check whether or not Delta is less than our threshold for convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "If it is, then we break out of the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've completed this loop, we found the optimal value function $V^*$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find the optimal policy $\\pi^*$, we need to loop through each state one last time\n",

    "So here are some interesting facts to note about value iteration\n",

    "Note how in this pseudocode, we end up with only one infinite loop that stops when $V(s)$ converges\n",
    "\n",
    "This is better than before where we had two nested infinite loops \n",
    "\n",
    "As before, while this one loop could potentially go on forever, practically speaking, we quit when the maximum change in $V(s)$ drops below some threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, note that we don't have to deal with the issue where more than one policy can lead to\n",
    "the optimal value function\n",
    "\n",
    "As we recall, for policy iteration, it's possible for us to flip flop between two different optimal\n",
    "policies, since optimal policies are not unique \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're now dealing with the value function which is unique, the knowing once you break out of the loop is easy\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, note the parallels between this and policy evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy evaluation is nothing but treating the Bellman equation as an update rule\n",
    "\n",
    "We take the right hand side and we assign it to the left hand side\n",
    "\n",
    "Convergence is achieved when the right hand side is equal to the left hand side, which is a fixed point for the update rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, value iteration is nothing but treating the Bellman optimality equation as an update rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we take the right hand side and assign it to the left hand side\n",

    "\n",
    "<h3>Dynamic Programming</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was all about how to solve two important problems in reinforcement learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous notebook showed us the framework for reinforcement learning problems, the MDP \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the MDP, we were able to build on this framework to solve the problems of prediction and control\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction problem is a given a policy tell me the value of that policy\n",
    "\n",
    "The control problem is given an environment, tell me the best policy\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "So to solve the prediction problem, we use policy evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "We learn that this is nothing but treating\n",
    "the Bellman equation like an update rule\n",
    "\n",
    "We noted that there are other solutions to this problem, such as using a basic linear solver\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is limited because it doesn't scale and it doesn't give us something to build on for later notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, we saw an example of that in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, value iteration is essentially just like policy evaluation, except that instead of doing a summation, we take the max\n",
    "\n",
    "So even in this notebook, we've seen how the dynamic programming approach is more powerful than solving a linear system of equations \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the control problem, we first learned about the principle of policy improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "It was here that we learned about the policy improvement theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "This theorem states that if changing an action  once improves the value for a given policy, then changing that action permanently for that state will lead to a better policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this theorem, we developed the process of policy iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy iteration solves the control problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start with a completely random policy and after running the process for long enough, we will end up with the optimal policy\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem we discovered with policy iteration is that it can potentially be very slow\n",
    "\n",
    "It has one infinite loop nested inside another infinite loop\n",
    "\n",
    "We then considered a new approach called value iteration that just has a single loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, value iteration is like policy iteration, except that we combine the evaluation step and the improvement step into a single operation\n",
    "\n",
    "This converges much faster than policy iteration, and it doesn't require us to even store a policy at all\n",
    "\n",
    "The policy is only computed after the value iteration loop is complete\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>But wait !!!</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting fact we may have noticed about this notebook is this \n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is supposed to be all about learning from experience\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a robot playing a game or solving a maze \n",
    "\n",
    "By playing the game or solving the maze a large number of times, it can use the rewards it achieved to learn the optimal policy\n",
    "\n",
    "What was interesting about this notebook was that no actual games were played, so why did this happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, no games were played because we had full knowledge about the dynamics of the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we knew as $p(s^\\prime,r \\vert s,a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The lesson is that, when we know this probability distribution, we don't actually need to play the game\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is just a matter of applying the Bellman equation or the Bellman optimality equation\n",
    "\n",
    "So is learning from experience unnecessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is no\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because in the real world, we don't know this probability distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine driving a car or playing a game of chess \n",
    "\n",
    "When we started the reinforcement learning series, we probably had in our minds this idea that we were going to teach and agents who play a game or solve some task \n",
    "\n",
    "We probably had in your mind that your program would learn from experience and not just use\n",
    "probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, of course, this is necessary in order to understand the next notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we will consider the more realistic scenario where this distribution is not known\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we must learn from experience\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, note that we have different names for these approaches \n",
    "\n",
    "When we know the transition probabilities, that is our model of the environment \n",
    "\n",
    "When we use this model to find the solution, we call this a model based approach\n",
    "\n",
    "When we learn from experience, we don't need a model of the environment, wo we call that a model free approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The few following notebooks, will focus on model free approaches \n",
    "\n",
    "In more advanced notebooks, we might go back to model based approaches or even combine these two approaches to get a hybrid approach"
